Connecting your H3 inverter can be acheived by:  
   
* Connecting to the (RasPi's) COM port using a [RS485 to USB](https://www.reichelt.de/raspberry-pi-usb-rs485-schnittstelle-ch340c-rpi-usb-rs485-p242783.html?&nbc=1) (Approved)
* Connecting to the home WiFi using a RS485 to WiFi dongle like the 'Elfin EW11A RS485 to WIFI converter'. [HowTo in the Wiki.](https://github.com/rsaemann/HA-FoxESS-H3-Modbus/wiki/RS485-via-Wifi) (Connects the RS485 pins on your inverter. This does not use the inverter's build-in WiFi or Ethernet connection.)

* ‚ö†Ô∏è Using the inverter's Ethernet LAN port or dongle to connect to your router/switch via Ethernet does **not** work for H3 inverters, yet. Port 502 is not open. This solution might be fixed with future firmware. It is not possible with firmware version Master 1.25-1.57, Slave 1.02, Manager 1.29 ‚ö†Ô∏è

<p>The aim of this project is to enable the full use of the Energy dashboard in Home Assistant and is a fully functional replacement of the FoxESS App for reporting needs.</p>

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Installation via HACS does not work for this fork due to naming convention

## Manual Specific installation
* Create the directory structure /config/custom_components/HA-FoxESS-Modbus/ (use the "file editor" addon of HA)
* Copy the required modbus file to /config/custom_components/HA-FoxESS-Modbus/
  * if you go with serial cable to USB connection use /config/custom_components/HA-FoxESS-Modbus/modbusH3USB.yaml
  * if you go with wifi to RS485 dongle use /config/custom_components/HA-FoxESS-Modbus/modbusLAN-H3.yaml

## Then, Common Installation Steps

* Create a full backup of your HA instance including the configuration.yaml file
* Copy the required modbus line (USB or Wifi) and following contents of the [configuration.yaml](https://github.com/rsaemann/HA-FoxESS-H3-Modbus/blob/main/custom_components/HA-FoxESS-Modbus/configuration.yaml) file to your config file
* Check your config is valid, then Restart HA
* Map energy dashboard as per below example and enjoy configuring dashboards using near realtime data.

## Engergy Dashboard Configuration

### Energy Dashboard Values

**Grid Consumption**
- meter_consumption_energy_daily  (only when SmartMeter is connected to inverter)
- inv_load_energy_daily  (inverter's output. use for island system)

**Return to Grid**
- meter_feed_in_energy_daily (only when SmartMeter is connected to inverter)

**Solar Panels**

- pv1_daily
- pv2_daily

  As an alternative:
- pv_energy_daily (direct cumulative PV1+PV2 from inverter)

**Home Batteries**

- battery_charge_energy_daily
- battery_discharge_energy_daily

## Provided Entities

**Registers**
**The [H3 registers wiki](https://github.com/rsaemann/HA-FoxESS-H3-Modbus/wiki/H3-Modbus-Registers) has references for the 3-phase registers.**

**The [H1 registers wiki](https://github.com/StealthChesnut/HA-FoxESS-Modbus/wiki/Data-Register-Reference---H1-AC1) shows the 1-phase registers.**

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter modbus reading errors:
- Disable unneeded sensors by commenting all lines, or delete the entries. [It was found](https://github.com/StealthChesnut/HA-FoxESS-Modbus/issues/62) that ``battery_voltage`` and ``battery_current`` are two sensors that do not respond to status requests correctly.
  <details><summary>Comment out in the modbusH3USB.yaml file</summary>
   <p>
      
  ```
  #  - name: "Battery Voltage"
  #    unique_id: foxess_inv1_battery_voltage
  #    scan_interval: 30
  #    address: 31034
  #    state_class: measurement
  #    unit_of_measurement: "V"
  #    data_type: int16
  #    scale: 0.1
  #    precision: 1
  #    device_class: voltage
  #    input_type: holding
  #  - name: "Battery Current"
  #    unique_id: foxess_inv1_battery_current
  #    scan_interval: 30
  #    address: 31035
  #    state_class: measurement
  #    unit_of_measurement: "A"
  #    data_type: int16
  #    scale: 0.1
  #    precision: 1
  #    input_type: holding      
  #    device_class: current
  ```
      
   </p>
</details>

- Increase the ``scan_interval`` for sensors that are not needed. The HA modbus integration requests every sensor register with a single call. If you have a large number of sensors here, the calls might interfere with each other.
